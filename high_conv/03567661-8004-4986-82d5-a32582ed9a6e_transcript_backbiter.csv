In the middle of Amish country, we have an amazing Mexican restaurant um right at the edge of our development, our our neighborhoods 10 miles long. Um So there's one exit that's seven miles out and there's a little mexican places literally a hole in the wall. But they make great mexican food. Uh They cracked me up because when you walk in, they have a table there that they're in the mexican restaurants, they're selling toilet paper and vinyl gloves and hand sanitizer. And I think alcohol or rubbing alcohol is on the table to and I mean I was like, are you kidding me? Like you can get a box of vinyl gloves for 10 bucks with the mexican restaurant, you know? And then when nobody else can get a toilet paper anywhere, they got their toilets literally when you walk in, it's like they took a table that they were serving people on and because they have to be spaced out anyway, and they just like, we're selling all this crap and I don't know where they're getting it from, but God love them because believe me, they are a resource, but they have really good food. I had a burger from there. My mom came from Florida a couple months ago and that's another good thing about living the country. Your mom can still come from Florida, you know? And but she wouldn't Kiss me or hug me. It was kind of sad. My mom is 70 years old. It kind of sucks you know. But I had this burger that I am not lying. This burger was this big, the bun was humongous and I had jalapeno peppers on it and it looks like a salad on top of the thing. So it took me like two meals. That's what I had.
