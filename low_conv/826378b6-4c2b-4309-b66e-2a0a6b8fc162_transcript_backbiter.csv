Uh it turns out the reason I was sent here, if you want to say by God or by the universe. I was followed by a whale kicking, dragged out of L. A. And kicking and screaming out of L. A. And dropped into this weird town in southwestern Ohio, where there was this methodist church that was almost dead. That was about ready to close. It was a 200 year old methodist church with a giant cathedral style sanctuary that needed my skills, which was the ability to take a bunch of music equipment speakers, uh, stereo, you know, speakers, monitors, amplifiers and so on so forth. They were all from entirely different periods of time in history and cobble them all together into systems that worked together to make music. And now I am, that is my primary job is I'm the Contemporary Music Director at First United Methodist Church in Hamilton Ohio, because that's what apparently was needed by them. And since then we have grown quite a bit because I happen to know that sound is important, something computer and geeks seemed to have never figured out The sound matters. And we've now got from where we had 22, 50 Older people and maybe 30 younger people, the 30 younger people at the morning at the early contemporary service, and then maybe 30 older people at the traditional service, we now get over almost 1000 views a week for our church service. So the idea of streaming is something that the church has just discovered as a thing that can be done and given me a budget to do it with an incredibly limited, limited budget. Actually, what they're doing is they're counting on the fact that I once again, I know how to kabul beat up old equipment together into something that works teaching.

In fact, the sound there is so good that local, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and various other the Ohio State University Orchestra and Choir. They come down here to report in that room because it's really cool. It's a great room for 1st sound, which was why many people think that they were pioneers because uh, a lot of people don't know that the Methodists did not even allow instruments inside the church Until 1928 Charles and john Wesley, especially Charles, Wesley wrote a lot of hymns, but they were not meant to be accompanied by anybody or anything.
